R client for CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) data

> Under the [World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) established the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) as a standard experimental protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Virtually the entire international climate modeling community has participated in this project since its inception in 1995.

## Install

Development version

```{r eval=FALSE}
devtools::install_github("ropenscilabs/cmipr")
```

```{r}
library("cmipr")
```

## List files

```{r}
cmip_list_files('bcsd/yearly')
cmip_list_files('bcsd/yearly/cccma_cgcm3_1.1')
```

## Download data

```{r}
key <- "bcsd/yearly/cnrm_cm3.1/cnrm_cm3.1.sresa1b.monthly.Prcp.2034.nc"
(res <- cmip_fetch(key))
```

## Read data into R

Can load in a single file (gives `RasterLayer`), or many (gives `RasterBrick`)

```{r}
out <- cmip_read(res)
```

## Plot

```{r fig.cap=""}
plot(out)
```
