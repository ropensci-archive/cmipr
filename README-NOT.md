R client for CMIP (Coupled Model Intercomparison Project) data

> Under the [World Climate Research Programme (WCRP)](https://www.wcrp-climate.org/) the Working Group on Coupled Modelling (WGCM) established the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) as a standard experimental protocol for studying the output of coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs). Virtually the entire international climate modeling community has participated in this project since its inception in 1995.
